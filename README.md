# Timed-Coding-Assessment
Timed coding quiz

## Description
This project was created to test future web developers on their existing coding knowledge. The subject of coding is incredibly robust and requires a lot of knowledge and practice. When you're interviewing for your first position as a web developer, you may find that you're required to take an assessment, similar to the one provided, in order to move forward in the interview process. Throughout coding this project, I learned how to tackle many bugs that arise when you're coding in JavaScript and how to correct them by reading my browser's console log. I also learned how to create a fairly lengthy function, containing multiple steps, variables, loops and if statements, all to reach the goal of automatically cycling through a large object.
